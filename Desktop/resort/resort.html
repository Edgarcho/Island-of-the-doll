  <h1>Island of the Dolls</h1>
  <h2>Located in a remote wooded area in Xochimilco, Mexico city</h2>

  <p>Founder Julian Santana Barrera, discovered corpse of a young girl
    - and the toy doll she left behind - floating in a nearby
    canal when he arrived. Barrera began to hear footsteps in the night and the
    anguished wails of a woman after he hung the doll from a tree
    He continued to hang other toy dolls from the trees in the 'chinampas' area
    to appease her ghost for over 50 years.
    His family now runs the area as tourist attraction where visitors hang
    other dolls and claim to hear them whispering.</p>

  <p>After a two-hour canal ride from Mexico City, they arrive at a nightmarish
     clearing deep in the woods where thousands of mutilated dolls hang from the
     trees and hide among the dense branches.</p>
